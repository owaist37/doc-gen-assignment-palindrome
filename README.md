# doc-gen-assignment

A small config-driven pipeline that turns a client's source material into an advice report. Start
with `PROJECT_GUIDANCE.md`; it describes the exercise.

## Setup

```bash
# clone your fork, then:
cp .env.example .env          # put your OpenAI key in .env
uv sync                       # or: pip install -e .
```

## Run

```bash
uv run python -m pipeline.generate --client client_01_clean
# report is written to outputs/client_01_clean.md
```

Available clients live under `data/`:

- `client_01_clean`
- `client_02_medium`
- `client_03_hard`
- `client_04_stretch` (large and messy on purpose; a deliberate stretch)

## How it fits together

```
config/template_config.json   defines the report: sections, prompts, inclusion rules, source maps
        │
        ▼
pipeline/generate.py          for each section: decide inclusion, fill its prompts from the
        │                     client's data, produce the section's content
        ▼
pipeline/formatter.py         assembles the sections into the final .md document
        │
        ▼
outputs/<client>.md
```

## The pipeline is deliberately minimal

What you are given is the smallest setup that runs end to end. It works, but it is naive: one model
call per section, every source dumped into every prompt, a single model, and no tools. Improving it
is part of the task; weigh speed, cost, and effectiveness (see `PROJECT_GUIDANCE.md`). Most of your
work will be in `config/template_config.json`; the pipeline code is yours to improve too.

## Notes

- The scaffold makes live OpenAI calls; you need a working key in `.env`.
- There are no expected-output files. Deciding what correct looks like, and checking it, is part of
  the task.
- Commit as you go; we read the history.
